# rock-paper-scissors

This project was made as a part of The Odin Project to practice my JavaScript skills - it's a basic Rock Paper Scissors game played in your browser's debugging console.

It can be played here: https://peterwaterhouse.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

Note - right click and inspect the page to make sure the console is open!
